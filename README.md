### Book Description

With the ever-increasing demand for machine learning and programming professionals, it's prime time to invest in the field. The current book aims to help you in this endeavor, focusing specifically on text data and human language. The book steers a middle path among the various textbooks which present complicated theoretical concepts or focus disproportionately on Python code.

A good metaphor this work builds upon is the relationship between an experienced craftsperson and their trainee. Based on the current problem, the former pick a tool from the toolbox, explains its utility and puts it into action. This approach will help you to identify at least one practical usage for each method or technique presented.

The content unfolds in ten chapters, each discussing one specific case study. For that reason, the book is solution-oriented, and it's accompanied by Python code in the form of Jupyter notebooks to help you obtain hands-on experience. A recurring pattern in the chapters is that we first try to get some intuition on the data and then implement and contrast various solutions.

By the end, you'll be able to understand and apply various techniques with Python for text preprocessing, text representation, dimensionality reduction, machine learning, language modeling, visualization, and evaluation.



### Who this book is for

The target audience of this book is professionals in the area of computer science, programming, data science, informatics, business analytics, statistics, language technology, and more who aim for a gentle career shift in machine learning for text. Students in relevant disciplines that seek a textbook in the field will benefit from the practical aspects of the content and how the theory is presented. Finally, professors teaching a similar course can pick topics that are pertinent in terms of content and difficulty. Beginner-level knowledge of Python programming is needed to learn from this book.
