<b>CNET | NEWS.COM WEEK IN REVIEW</b><br>
The Entire Tech Week in a Single Email<br>
Saturday, July 13, 2002<p>
<b>If you've ever taped a "Seinfeld" episode or traded music online, Uncle =
Sam may want you--to stop.</b>

<p>

Draft legislation that is winding its way through Congress would sharply li=
mit Americans' rights relating to copying music, taping TV shows and transf=
erring files through the Internet. The first part of their proposal, which =
would <a href=3D"http://clickthru.online.com/Click?q=3D8b-SBGBQY0y2oGDikAEY=
IEElDh4B1FR" >limit backup copies</a>, has drawn objections from academics =
and nonprofit groups that have reviewed it.

<p>

Under current copyright law, Americans who record a TV program or radio seg=
ment generally may "sell or otherwise dispose of" that analog recording or =
digital file as they wish.

<p>

The proposed bill would end that exemption, handing copyright owners substa=
ntial new control over the distribution of their works by curtailing a cons=
umer's right to copy material under a doctrine known as "fair use."

<p>

Another salvo in the copyright battle was delivered when a federal judge sa=
id that record labels and film studios could <a href=3D"http://clickthru.on=
line.com/Click?q=3Da0-11h8QQBqNNjxwbcUByjw2PB1s79R" >expand an ongoing copy=
right lawsuit</a> to include Sharman Networks, which distributes the popula=
r Kazaa software.

<p>

The Recording Industry Association of America and the Motion Picture Associ=
ation of America last October sued three prominent file-swapping companies =
in Los Angeles federal court. The suit named Morpheus parent StreamCast Net=
works, Grokster and Kazaa BV, the Netherlands-based company that originally=
 created the Kazaa software.

<p>

However, in February, Kazaa BV sold the Kazaa file-swapping software to Sha=
rman, a company later revealed to be based in Vanuatu, a small island in th=
e South Pacific. The recording and movie industry trade groups asked permis=
sion to add that company to the lawsuit in June. A judge ruled this week th=
at Sharman could be added to the lawsuit.

<p>

<b><font color=3D"#CC0000">Shoring up U.S. security </font></b><br>

Computer security is becoming <a href=3D"http://clickthru.online.com/Click?=
q=3Db5-50FcQ7U79NyMUQi1PHq15ZNEEZuR" >increasingly critical</a> to Presiden=
t Bush's proposal for a homeland defense department. When Bush formally pro=
posed the department last month, he never mentioned the Internet or so-call=
ed cybersecurity.

 <p>

But as Capitol Hill scrutinizes the proposal, politicians are fretting abou=
t tech-savvy terrorists--and insisting any new agency must shield the Unite=
d States from electronic attacks as well. House Republicans have asked comm=
ittees for any suggested changes to the White House-backed bill by the end =
of the week.

<p>

Included in the proposal are radical changes for the U.S. government's Inte=
rnet defenses. The plan would stitch together nearly all computer protectio=
n functions, from the Commerce Department's Critical Infrastructure Assuran=
ce Office to the Computer Security Division of the National Institute of St=
andards and Technology to the Federal Computer Incident Response Center.

<p>

Additionally, the proposed department is likely to get its own <a href=3D"h=
ttp://clickthru.online.com/Click?q=3Dca-iciuQUgF71gRVXMcl8jfOfRHHUsR" >priv=
acy czar</a>. A draft of the legislation seen by CNET News.com states that =
the Secretary of Homeland Security must appoint a privacy officer to ensure=
 that new technologies "sustain and do not erode" privacy protections and t=
o verify that the agency's massive databases operate within federal guideli=
nes.

<p>

<b><font color=3D"#CC0000">Who's running your computer? </font></b><br>



Perhaps a more immediate security concern to individuals is what is going o=
n now with their computers.

<p>



Apple Computer OS X users could let hackers <a href=3D"http://clickthru.onl=
ine.com/Click?q=3Ddf-1kJhQLEFh2TGWRjfbQq-Kh1XhaZR" >piggyback malicious cod=
e</a> on downloads from the company's SoftwareUpdate service.  According to=
 the BugTraq mailing list, a hacker named Russell Harding has posted full i=
nstructions for how to fool Apple's SoftwareUpdate feature to allow a hacke=
r to install a backdoor on any Mac running OS X.

<p>

The exploit takes advantage of SoftwareUpdate, Apple's software updating me=
chanism in OS X, which checks weekly for new updates from the company. Acco=
rding to Harding, who claims to have discovered the exploit, the feature do=
wnloads updates over the Web with no authentication and installs them on a =
system. So far, there are no patches available for this problem.

<p>

Users of Microsoft's Internet Explorer, Outlook and Outlook Express applica=
tions <a href=3D"http://clickthru.online.com/Click?q=3Df5-lTbRQgwxlE6ooZY6D=
mLwgkaZmRuR" >may be vulnerable</a> to a recently discovered software flaw =
that could leave their system open to malicious code carried on Web pages o=
r in e-mails. A security researcher and partner at risk-assessment company =
PivX Solutions warned that HTML objects embedded in Web pages and e-mail co=
uld carry code that allows an attacker to check out victims' cookie files, =
read their documents and execute programs on their computer.

<p>

Still another problem is plaguing Outlook: A popular plug-in that lets user=
s encrypt and digitally sign messages has <a href=3D"http://clickthru.onlin=
e.com/Click?q=3D0a-ZnKCIrrs-4R73PWBwhq6GOxuYzsR" >inadvertently weakened</a=
> security and left the mail program open to attack. Security company eEye =
Digital Security issued a warning late Wednesday to users of Network Associ=
ates' Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) plug-in for Outlook, saying that a vulnerab=
ility in the add-on could let attackers execute malicious software on a vic=
tim's computer.

<p>

<b><font color=3D"#CC0000">Wi-Fi everywhere, but not everyone</font></b><br=
>

One of the first cameras that can shuttle photos and videos using the Wi-Fi=
 wireless networking technology has made its <a href=3D"http://clickthru.on=
line.com/Click?q=3D1f-rvwqI58wtiBX5xU1xmYgHobjqmZR" >debut</a>. IQinVision =
plans to sell the camera to companies such as security firms that need to p=
ut video cameras in places where wires can't go, or as a way to quickly ins=
tall a temporary security system.

<p>

This product is among the first devices to combine digital videography and =
wireless LANs (local area networks) that use the Wi-Fi, or 802.11b, standar=
d. Expect more digital camera makers to follow suit. The number of digital =
cameras has been on the rise, and it's only a matter of time before a camer=
a maker wants to add a popular new technology like Wi-Fi.

<p>

Wi-Fi is also <a href=3D"http://clickthru.online.com/Click?q=3D34-pJpSIcd8l=
d53rX23_tvVyn4IcgdR" >invading handheld devices</a>. Wireless equipment mak=
er Intersil is working with SyChip to incorporate 802.11b wireless networki=
ng technology into a Secure Digital (SD) card for handheld devices. The car=
d, which should be available to manufacturers for testing in the fourth qua=
rter, lets handheld owners add and remove wireless networking capabilities =
to handhelds that contain an SD slot from Palm, Hewlett-Packard and other c=
ompanies.

<p>

Wireless SD cards would make it far easier for handheld manufacturers and o=
wners to get these devices linked. Only a few handhelds include wireless ca=
pabilities, and they are some of the most expensive on the market. With the=
 card, wireless access becomes an option for many.

<p>

Not everyone is pleased with the explosion in popularity of wireless networ=
king. Broadband providers are <a href=3D"http://clickthru.online.com/Click?=
q=3D49-ZM4cIEpSm4ht0v3VX4RVXFO5JSrR" >cracking down</a> on some customers, =
threatening to cut service to those who set up the inexpensive wireless sys=
tems and allow others to freely tap into their Internet access.

<p>

After being introduced just a couple of years ago, so-called Wi-Fi "hot spo=
ts" that tap into cable or digital subscriber lines (DSL) are now in at lea=
st 15 million homes and offices. The problem is that one paying subscriber =
can set up a local network that allows several other people to access the N=
et, for fun or for profit.

<b><font color=3D"#CC0000">News.com special focus: China</font></b><br>



As China's society changes and its education system matures, the country is=
 becoming a major consumer and producer of computer products. And as the gl=
obal recession leaves few fertile opportunities elsewhere, China has emerge=
d as a primary target for foreign business. A News.com three-part <a href=
