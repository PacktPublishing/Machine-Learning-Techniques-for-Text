No...the list has been on target i'd say about 95% of the time.
Iff it starts being a problem, consider it. Right now, John's
right - this remove thread is taking more time than any remove
requests have in the entire past year.

One thing you may want to consider (if feasible) - BugTraq's
adopted a technique by which they add headers to each message
indicating where to email to remove. The catch: the mail is
not sent to "majordomo" - it is sent to "listname-remove"@domain.
I've found that useful when I can't remember exactly which mail
addr I used to signup (since my email addr never shows up in
a received message, and I have multiple addresses going to the
same box).

For all that, remember, even if you put the actual removal
instructions right in the bottom of your email, you will
_still_ get the clueless asking you how to remove. (Trust me,
we've been there.)
