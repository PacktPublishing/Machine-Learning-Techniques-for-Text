                                >> MINI NEWS <<
                               time for a snooze

         There comes a time in every August when news services should
         just shut the hell up, because the weather's too hot or too
         underwater, and the world grows so dull and hazy that even
         the overexcitable hardcore at LinuxWorld wander around like
         it's Undead Expo 2002, and the Weiss-baked Macintoxins can
         barely lift their wallets for MacOS X.2, and Sun can't be
         bothered to do anything but run s/RedHat/Sun Linux/g on a
         free distribution disk, and everyone else is on holiday, or
         getting ready to be on holiday, or being told that perhaps
         they should take a holiday RIGHT NOW, and all we can do is
         look at this awful, awful EUCD legislation and stare out the
         window until dawn.

         Yeah, it's our annual no news edition. We moved to a faster
         server. Do take the rest of the weekend off in celebration.

         Or, alternatively, build up a head of overexcitement for
         the public appearance of THOMAS DOLBY - the "Hyperactive"
         chart artist and Beatnik audio plug-in advocate who, even as
         you read this, appears to be hosting a 350 Euro-per-head
         seminar on COMPOSING POLYPHONIC RING TONES at Helsinki's
         Radisson Royal Hotel in Finland. Lucky delegates will learn
         about "using real-time MIDI controllers for tweaked
         effects", "techniques for making little speakers sound huge"
         and - perhaps most distressingly - "picking the right
         instrument and register for best audibility". The
         cacophonous cavalcade comes to London's Soho House on Tue
         and Wed next week if you'd like to check it out for
         yourself - or perhaps hold a street protest on behalf of
         music lovers worldwide.

           - So they're better than monophonic ringtones. What isn't?

                         goto's considered non-harmful

         Boasting technical seminars, interplay of technological ideas
         and, of course, beer, this year's LINUXBIERWANDERUNG (from Sat
         2002-08-24, Doolin, Co. Clare, Ireland, for a "small voluntary
         donation" per hiker) might just be the only walking holiday
         you ever persuade your company to pay for. Continuing the
         outdoor theme, somewhat shorter notice for this Sunday's
         GREATER LONDON LINUX USER GROUP BLETCHLEY PARK PICNIC (around
         12noon, Sun 2002-08-18, Bletchley, near Milton Keynes, UKP6
         admission fee). And for anyone who can't make the whole week
         in Ireland, there's some consolation in the form of LONDON
         PERLMONGERS PRESENT: DAMIEN CONWAY AT THE CONWAY HALL (6pm,
         Tue 2002-08-27 and Thu 2002-08-29, Conway Hall, London WC1R,
         free) - hopefully just the start of a similarly-named speaker/
         venue trend which will also see Larry Wall performing at the
         Great Wall Of China, and Eric Raymond at London's Raymond
         Revue Bar.

               sufficiently advanced technology : the gathering

         Dijkstra finally gone? Great. Now we can hang out with those
         sloppy little unrigorous languages he never let into the
         house. Right on cue: the latest dev version of GNU
         SMALLTALK, that dirty treat-me-like-an-object ducky. Version
         2.0b sprouts HTML-embedding and experimental MySQL support -
         implying you might actually be able to do something useful
         with it. Admittedly, "useful" has not been a word  much used
         in the Smalltalk community recently. Many of the current
         addicts seem to live entirely in the pleasuredomes of that
         Land of Infinite Fun, Alan Kay's Smalltalk sequel SQUEAK,
         the cross-platform UI-kablooie playground which, over time,
         been overloaded with more ill-fitting metaphors than this
         sentence. But even Squeak is showing signs of returning to
         planet Earth. Talk of cleaning up the object tree are rife;
         coders are working on XP-alike skins (instead of Squeak's
         peculiarly homely interface right now). There's even word of
         a SmallTalkish scripting language in the offing. And all
         those new MacOS X Objective C hackers are following the
         trail back to the NeXT's great ancestor, giving a timely
         boost to the tribe. Xerox Parc *will* return!

                                  get out less

         TV>> the objection that "Elvis - was a hero to most, but he
         never meant shit to me" is addressed in ENTERTAINING ELVIS
         (1.35am, Fri, ITV), in which "The King" offers his views on
         our modern-day pop acts... the horror continues in the form of
         CANDYMAN II (1.10am, Fri, C4) and William Peter "The Exorcist"
         Blatty's psycho-nonsense THE NINTH CONFIGURATION (2.45am, Fri,
         C4)... and Jason "Seinfeld" Alexander plays one of a bunch of
         gay friends - not that there's anything wrong with that - in
         LOVE! VALOUR! COMPASSION! (12.40am, Fri, C5)... Jarvis Cocker
         *is* Rolf Harris, while "Allstars" impersonate the recently
         deceased "Steps" in CELEBRITY STARS IN THEIR EYES (8.30pm,
         Sat, ITV)... Sarah Michelle Gellar and Selma "Legally Blonde"
         Blair put the "les" back into "Les Liaisons Dangereuses" in
         their noted http://www.girlskissing.co.uk/video.htm classic
         CRUEL INTENTIONS (9.30pm, Sat, C4)... leading into a late-
         night character actor fest featuring Paul "Boogie Nights"
         Anderson's feature debut HARD EIGHT (12.35am, Sat, BBC2),
         David Mamet's Steve Martin con-game THE SPANISH PRISONER
         (1.20am, Sat, C4), and Oirish juvenile delinquent coming-of-
         ager THE BUTCHER BOY (12.55am, Sat, C5)... things get back to
         normal on Sunday with the incomprehensible remake of MISSION:
         IMPOSSIBLE (8.15pm, Sun, BBC1) - not to be confused with the
         simultaneously fruitless THE HUNT FOR THE ANTHRAX KILLER (9pm,
         Sun, BBC2)... Christina Ricci, Lisa Kudrow comedy THE OPPOSITE
         OF SEX (10pm, Sum, C4) has snappy script, no plot... and it's
         the final episode of the seemingly interminable 24 (10pm, Sun,
         BBC2): http://www.doyourecall.co.uk/ ... the - presumably
         rhetorically titled - DID BARRY GEORGE KILL JILL DANDO? (9pm,
         Mon, C4) and WHO KILLED SIMONE VALENTINE? (11.05pm, Mon, C4)
         are helpfully scheduled either either side of SIX FEET UNDER
         (10pm, Mon, C4)... Michael "David St Hubbins" McKean moves
         into management in sub-"Spinal Tap" hostage romp AIRHEADS
         (10.55pm, Mon, C5)... the consistently worrying TEENAGE KICKS
         (10pm, Tue, C4) looks at "Teenage Dwarfs" - next week:
         "Teenage Dirtbags"?... and http://www.diffusiononline.net/
         inspiration BARGAIN HUNT (8pm, Thu, BBC1) arrives on prime-
         time - frankly we still prefer his mix of "147 Lockdown"...

         FILM>> if they'd used the proper mathematical sigma symbol in
         the title, then the sequel could have been called "The
         Derivative Of Distress - With Respect To Terror" for largely
         humourless feelgood nuclear thriller THE SUM OF ALL FEARS
       ( http://www.screenit.com/movies/2002/the_sum_of_all_fears.html :
         We see [Bridget "Coyote Ugly" Moynahan] in bed, showing some
         cleavage; the camera briefly focuses on some cheerleaders'
         clothed butts during the Super Bowl)... oh and it's the full
         release this week for SPY KIDS 2: THE ISLAND OF LOST DREAMS
         ( http://www.capalert.com/capreports/spykids2.htm : telepathy;
         pelvic thrusts by a child; drinking with multiple drugging;
         "Let's kick their [posteriors]" - which is not included in the
         list of three/four letter word vocabulary but is impudent;
         toilet humor - smothering in a pile of dung with fecal matter
         in mouth)...

         CONFECTIONERY THEORY>> "Are you tracking breakfast cereal?"
         inquired a concerned LLOYD WOOD, after recently wandering into
         the "kiddy end" of the cereal aisle. "They've all gone CD-ROM
         on the front", he observed - causing him, for a moment to
         think he was looking at "some really bloated computer
         magazines". Of course we are, Lloyd, though we're not as
         easily swayed by gimmicks as you are, and thus can impartially
         report that NESTLE's Maryland-style COOKIE CRISP are the most
         biscuit-like breakfast ever, easily triumphing over KELLOGG's
         FROSTIES CHOCOLATE (too much chocolate, not enough "frosty"),
         COCO POPS CRUNCHERS (clump together in this humid weather) and
         even the Winnie The Pooh-themed DISNEY HUNNY B's - and if you
         mix them all together, the milk goes so chocolatey it'll turn
         your Pooh brown... elsewhere in dairy, MCDONALD'S continue a
         disappointing run of toppings for the MCFLURRY (99p) -
         Cadbury's Caramel is rubbish, and Jammie Dodgers not a patch
         on our second-favourite McFlurry of all time, the Strawberry
         Crunch: http://www.ntk.net/index.cgi?b=02001-08-10&l=286#l .
         Reader ED AVIS complains that KFC don't tell you that their
         "M&M" AVALANCHE (also 99p) does not feature real M&Ms but
         "special miniaturised ones", which he describes as "frozen
         solid" and "might as well be small bits of gravel for all the
         chocolate flavour they impart". While, following last week's
         announcement of Ice T's Posse Pops, CRAIG LEFF thought we'd be
         reassured by the news that NBC are launching their own range
         of TV-themed Baskin-Robbins ice-creams, including a "Fear
         Factor" flavour designed to recreate the experience of eating
         "dirt and spiders": http://www.adage.com/news.cms?newsId=35520
         ... back with confectionery, LEON VERRALL remained unimpressed
         with STARBURST FRUITINESSE (from 49p, "tasted of plastic...
         [resembled] those 'food pills' they thought we'd all be eating
         by now"), DAVID BLANE grudgingly approved of the TWIX TRIPLE
         CHOC LIMITED EDITION ("Not bad, faintly evoking Penguins,
         which I never liked because of the thick chocolate"), and the
         whole point of that controversial "It's not for girls"
         campaign was revealed: to position NESTLE DOUBLE CREAM (40p)
         as a more female-friendly version of the YORKIE BAR. Other
         treats to look forward to in coming weeks: Cola-flavoured
         CADBURY-TREBOR REFRESHERS, chicken-wings-flavoured HULA HOOPS,
         bacon QUAVERS, the (presumably) non-crisp-like GOLDEN WONDER
         FRUIT WONDERS - or, indeed, any of this weird new American
         stuff: http://www.candyusa.org/Press/New/ace2002.shtml ,
         ranging from SCORNED WOMAN CHOCOLATE JALAPENO FUDGE to SOFT
         AND CHEWY STINKY FEET ("Mmm, these feet are *so* stinky")...
