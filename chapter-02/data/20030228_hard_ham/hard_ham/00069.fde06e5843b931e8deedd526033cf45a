It's official: Gretchen, Sprocket, and I will be moving in a few
weeks. Not too far, though. We'll be going deeper into the city of
San Francisco starting on the first of September. Lori and Norm
were here over the weekend (for a photo shoot); in between sets,
Gretchen invited them to join her hunt. They came upon a house
located in one of the busier parts of town. With only street
parking available, I wasn't too thrilled about investigating the
property. However, my wife seemed optimistic. We kinda knew what
we were looking for in a residence (and its neighborhood), but
also knew we'd have to make certain concessions in the process. We
parked (literally) up the hill and found our way to what would
turn out to be our future home (at least, for the next year or
so). It has lots of usable space - which is a premium here. Plus,
the landlords are extremely dog-friendly. Winner! The pictures and
videos will come, never fear.

First order of business: get broadband! According to AT&T's Web
site, cable modem service is not available in the area. However,
DSL is an option. So, it looks like I'm going to be purchasing an
external <A HREF="http://lockergnome.pricegrabber.com/search_gen.php?form_keyword=dsl%20modem">DSL
modem</A> in a few days. Any suggestions?
Yeah, I'm not even sure who I'll select for my provider. They
currently use SBC to get online, so I might just stick with them
for continuity's sake. Verizon has been solid enough for me here,
but I believe our loft complex has a unique infrastructure. If I
could make contact with someone from any capable system, I'd
probably go with them. I should probably get the ball rolling
soon, though - I'd hate to play the waiting game for too long.
I've heard of installation nightmares, so I'll probably be rolling
my own (again). 56k is quaint, but hardly enough pipe to get any
real work done. When you download as much as I do, every bit
counts. Oh, and did I tell you about the bites?

<p>


There are plenty of unique restaurants in just about every
direction. Plus, we're right up around the corner from a Peet's
outlet! If you need me, you know where you can find me. I'll
probably also be setting up a Wi-Fi network before too long, too.
My Proxim hardware still works, but I wasn't sure if I needed a
crossover cable to connect it to my router. Furo tells me: "If the
hub has an uplink port, then a straight cable should work between
the two, as it provides the crossover for you. If both have uplink
and non-uplink ports (workstation attachment ports), then you
would need a crossover cable between like ports. For instance, if
you were connecting a workstation port on one to a workstation
port on another, you'd have to use a crossover. Same for uplink to
uplink." How's that for home network helpfulness? Oh, if only he'd
do a free <a href="http://www.gnometomes.com/">Gnometome</a> for
us...

{Find Web site remnants} Who knows what evils lurk on the hard
drives of mine? I'm always curious about what has been downloaded
to my PC after I have visited a website. I suppose I COULD clear
out my Temporary Internet Files before going to every single
page... or I could just install Traces Viewer. This handy
application gives me the power to see what my PC acquires for
every website I visit. With Traces Viewer's easy-to-read
interface, I can see what files come from each site, and also if
the site contained any cookies.  Mmmmmm, cookies... now, how could

{Make your own icons} I have a compulsive habit of changing the
original desktop and icons in Windows to a version that mirrors my
personality. So what happens if I can't find a desktop or set of
icons that suits me? I load up Pixel Toolbox! This program allows
me to flex my creative skills by creating Windows icons and
pointers. Find yourself in a creativity slump? Well, you don't
have to strain your creative muscle. PixelToolbox allows you to
import an image that you already own, and work from there. If that
isn't enough, you can fashion your own tiled desktop or share your
creation with friends by exporting your masterpiece as a .jpg,
.png, .tga, or .tif file.

software piracy, could you prove them wrong? With the Software

piece of software you own with this application; you can attach an
image of your paper receipt, add information like serial numbers
and activation keys, etc., so you will never be left hunting for
these items in the future. SAPP can even create and print reports
detailing your inventory. If you own a small company and want to
make confirm that you and your employees are "Software Compliant,"
this is the program for you. You can track your software using
many different variables such as License, User ID, Software Title
or Activation Key. Don't get caught second-guessing... be certain
with the Software Audit Protection Program!

<b>Print! v1.6 [319k] W9x/2k/XP US$39</b><br>
    Unearthed by Rob Muller
<p>
<a class="URL" href="http://www.robsoftware.com/">http://www.robsoftware.com/</a>
<p>

{Screen print utility} Time is money, and I endorse any program
that can save me time. Luckily, that is exactly what Print! v1.6
does. Say that I want to share screenshots with my other tech
friends to compare error messages and talk about possible fixes:
every time I take a screen shot, I open up Word, paste the
snapshot, and THEN I can print it. Too many steps, too much of my
time! With Print!, I just hit my "Print Screen" key and out comes
my screenshot without involving any other programs. Don't want a
screenshot of your whole desktop? Not a problem, just press Alt +
Print Screen and you'll have a printout of the active window only.
Print! 1.6 goes so far as to put the date and time on your
printout too... perfect for saving those high scores on solitaire!
Other features include scaling, centering, and the ability to
invert images. (So, not only will you save time, you'll also save
on toner. Bonus!)  You may also want to note that Print! saves
your printer configuration without wreaking havoc on the settings
in your other programs. You'll definitely get your money's worth
with this program. Don't believe me? Start by checking out the
evaluation version for yourself!

Gretchen is a self-professed pack rat: there are just some things
that she can't throw away. For example, books. I, on the other
hand, prefer my text in an electronic medium, and don't really
miss those analog versions. (What's that stuff called again?
Paper?) Many of my books are gathering dust on the bookshelf. The
alternative? Free them into the wild! BookCrossing is essentially
a worldwide book club. You register online and get a BookCrossing
ID number to put on your books with a note sending the new reader
back to BookCrossing (think of wheresgeorge.com). Then you just
leave the book "in the wild" to be found by someone else; the
folks at BookCrossing suggest a park bench, the pocket of an
airplane seat, or just plain giving your book to a friend. "Sounds
easy, right? Well it is. It's also a fascinating exercise in fate,
karma, or whatever you want to call the chain of events that can
occur between two or more lives and one piece of literature. Oh,
and we should mention, it's absolutely free and absolutely
private, too." BookCrossing also offers book reviews, ratings, and
recommendations.

Any modem that relies on Windows to function is dubbed a
"Winmodem." Most manufacturers use "Winmodems" because they are
cheap and easy to set up on a standard model PC. I don't have any
problem with the manufacturer saving money (because living in a
capitalistic society, I would hope that the savings would trickle
down to ME in one way or another). I do, however, have a problem
with the way "Winmodems" function after you add more internal
devices to your PC. "Winmodems" rely on Windows to mediate their
serial communication (I/O address, COM port, IRQ, etc.) and as you
can imagine, the more devices Windows has to manage, the higher
the probability of running into a problem. And what if you want to
run Linux instead? Will the "Winmodem" function well, if at all,
in an operating system other than Windows? Don't bet on it! If you
want to make sure you don't have any problems after upgrading your
system, you'll want to get yourself a hardware modem. How can you
determine this? Checking a modem's system requirements. If the
modem says it REQUIRES Windows, then keep looking... you've found
yourself a "Winmodem." However, if the system requirements for the
modem say that it will work with Linux, then you've found yourself
a hardware modem. Yes, it IS that easy.
