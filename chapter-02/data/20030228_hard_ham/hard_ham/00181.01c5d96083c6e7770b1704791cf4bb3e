0. INTRO

Hello SourceForge.net Users,

This week we've made a big announcement.  As you likely know, any
large dynamic website is powered by a database that funnels data to
the web servers serving data which ultimately gets sent to you.
These databases manage everything from user authentication, session
management, site searching, etc.  SourceForge.net is a database-
dependent website.

Today we have announced that we are moving SourceForge.net to DB2,
a powerful relational database by IBM.  We are doing this because
the site continues to grow at a rapid rate, with 700 new users and
70 new projects a day, and we need a database that can handle this
growth.  We feel that DB2 can do this for us, and IBM is giving us
the resources to make this transition successful.  You can read the
press release here:

http://www.vasoftware.com/news/press.php/2002/1070.html

How will this effect you?  In the first phase, you won't see much
difference other then the site will continue to grow and the
SourceForge.net team will be able to handle the growth.  In later
phases you will see new features on the site that take advantage of
the databases advanced capabilities.

Today our mail archives have been converted over.  The rest of the
site will make the migration to DB2 in the coming months.

If you have questions about this or any other aspect of the site,
please feel free to email me, pat@sourceforge.net.  I always
appreciate the feedback.

Thank you for your continued support of SourceForge.net and the
Open Source Community.

Pat-

Patrick McGovern
Director, SourceForge.net



1. INCREASED DOWNLOAD CAPACITY

SourceForge.net continues to grow, and it's appetite for bandwidth
is never-ending.  Every day SF.NET serves over 300,000 files to
ensure that developers and end-users within the Open Source
community can always obtain the software released by hosted
projects, SourceForge.net maintains a network of high-capacity
download servers.  These servers are located throughout the world,
as to provide better download times regardless of which network
provider you are using, and regardless of your geographic location.

Three new download servers have recently been added to our network,
further strengthening our file serving capabilities.  These latest
additions include servers hosted by:

Time Warner Telecom (Wisconsin,USA);
http://www.twtelecom.com/

University of Minnesota (Minnesota, USA)
http://www.umn.edu/

CESNET (Czech Republic)
http://www.cesnet.cz/

We thank these sponsors for their commitment to SourceForge.net and
the needs of the Open Source community.

On a related note, we are looking for a mirror in Japan.  If you are
an ISP or University in Japan and are willing to spare 20Mbps for a
SourceForge.net mirror (we'll supply the hardware), please let us
know at bandwidth@sourceforge.net



2. AUDIO OF KERNEL SUMMIT AVAILABLE

SourceForge.net now has the audio from the entire 2002 OSDN/USENIX

3. CONTRIBUTE TO SOURCEFORGE.NET! BE A FOUNDRY GUIDE!

Want to contribute to SourceForge.net, but you don't know how to
code? Be a foundry guide!  Foundry guides get to hype the cool
projects that they think are worth downloading and testing.
A guide finds all the stuff on the web about their subject of
choice, and gives it prominent placement.  How do you become a
foundry guide? Go to http://foundries.sourceforge.net/; find a
topic that interests you; and send email to
foundries@sourceforge.net stating your desired topic and why you
are qualified to be a foundry guide.

EMAIL LIST REMOVAL:

When the SF.NET team sends out a site-wide email, we sometimes see
replies that look like this:  "Hey!! I didn't subscribe to this list!!!
You spammer. I hate you!  I hate your dog!  (insert other colorful
phrases here)".  The truth is, when you registered on SourceForge.net
there was a check box that said "Receive Site-wide updates, low
volume".  You left it checked when you submitted the registration form,
hence you are receiving this email.  We send these updates every 4 to 6
weeks, so it truly is low volume.  However if you want off, this is not
a problem.  Simply click on the link below.
