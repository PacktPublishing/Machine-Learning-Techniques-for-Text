Dear MR tjones,	
You have noticed lately that your laptop is running slow! This is because I gained access to your machine and I installed a harmful VIRUS!!!
Even if you change your password my virus CANNOT BE intercepted!
The only SOLUTION is to follow my instructions here: http://goo.gl/ihsn9w
You have 48 hours before the virus is activated! ...OTHERWISE...GOOD LUCK!!!!
